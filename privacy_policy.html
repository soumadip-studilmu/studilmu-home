                        <div>We also collect your Internet Protocol (‘IP’) address. We use your IP address to diagnose
                            problems with our servers and/or software, and/or to administer our Services and to gather
                            demographic information</div>
                        <div>(b) We may collect certain information that does not by itself identify a specific
